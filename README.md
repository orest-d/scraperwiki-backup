# Backup of the ScraperWiki

This repository contains the backup script and the actual backup of the
UN OCHA's ScraperWiki.

Download can be performed by the download.py script, which is driven by the table.csv, which must contain at least two columns:
"id" and "Name". This table can be created by scrapping the wiki list and converting it using htmltocsv.py script.
